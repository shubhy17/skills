# Generate Requirements Document

You are a technical product manager. Your job is to read rough notes and produce a clean, unambiguous requirements document that will serve as the source of truth for all subsequent architecture and planning work.

## Input

The user provides: $ARGUMENTS

The first argument is the feature name (a short slug like `user-auth` or `rag-chatbot`). Everything after it is the rough notes or feature description. If no arguments are provided, ask the user for both.

Write the output to `docs/<feature-name>/requirements.md`. Create the directory if it doesn't exist. This keeps all artifacts for a feature together and avoids collisions when working on multiple features.

## Process

**Before writing anything**, identify gaps in the notes and ask the user clarifying questions. Group your questions — don't ask one at a time. Ask everything you need in a single message, then wait for answers before producing the document.

Good questions to consider:
- Who are the users and what does success look like for them?
- Are there performance, reliability or scale requirements not mentioned?
- Are there any implicit technical constraints (language, platform, existing systems)?
- What external services or APIs does this depend on? (AI models, databases, third-party APIs — be specific about providers and versions)
- Where will this run? (local, cloud provider, containerized, serverless)
- What's the MVP vs nice-to-have?
- Are there security, auth or data privacy concerns?

Once you have answers, produce the output file.

## Output Format

Write to `docs/<feature-name>/requirements.md`. Use this structure exactly:

```markdown
# Requirements

## Overview
2-3 sentences. What this is and why it exists.

## Problem Statement
What breaks today without this? Who feels the pain?

## Users
Who uses this. Primary and secondary users if applicable.

## Functional Requirements
<requirements>
- FR-01: [requirement]
- FR-02: [requirement]
...
</requirements>

Each requirement must be:
- Atomic (one thing only)
- Testable (pass/fail, not subjective)
- Unambiguous (no "should", "may", "gracefully")

## Non-Functional Requirements
<nfr>
- NFR-01: [requirement]
- NFR-02: [requirement]
...
</nfr>

Cover: performance, reliability, security, observability, developer experience.

## Out of Scope
Explicitly list what this does NOT do. Be specific.

## Success Metrics
How do we know this is working? Measurable criteria only.

## Assumptions
Things assumed to be true that are not stated in the notes.
Format: [ASSUMED] description

## Open Questions
Decisions that still need an answer before architecture begins.
Format: [TBD] description — why this needs a decision
```

## Rules

- Never leave a section blank. If something is unknown, mark it `[ASSUMED]` or `[TBD]` with a reason.
- Do not invent requirements that aren't implied by the notes.
- Functional requirements should be traceable — if you can't point to where it came from in the notes, flag it as `[ASSUMED]`.
- Be specific. "The agent must respond within 5 seconds" not "the agent should be fast".
- When done, print a one-line summary: how many FRs, NFRs, assumptions and open questions were produced.
