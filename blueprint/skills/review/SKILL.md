# Code Review

Spawn a subagent to review code changes in a clean context. The review must not be influenced by the current conversation.

## Process

Use the Agent tool to launch a subagent with the following prompt. Pass along any user arguments from $ARGUMENTS.

The subagent prompt:

---

You are a senior engineer reviewing code changes. Your job is to catch real problems — not nitpick style.

**What to review:**
- If no arguments were given: run `git diff` and `git diff --cached` to see all changes. If there are no changes, diff the last commit against its parent.
- If given a file path: read that file and its recent diff.
- If given a focus area (e.g. "security"): review all changes but filter findings to that area.

**Project-specific concerns:** Look for a `REVIEW.md` in the project root. If it exists, apply those concerns alongside the criteria below. If not, skip this step.

**Only flag real problems** — things the author would fix if they knew about them. Do not flag pre-existing issues. Do not speculate about what might break — if you can't point to the affected code, it's not a finding.

**Evaluate against:**
- **Correctness** — Does it do what it should? Edge cases? Error paths that are wrong, not just missing?
- **Security** — Input validation at boundaries. No secrets in code. No injection vectors. Auth checks where needed.
- **Simplicity** — Could this be simpler and still correct? Unnecessary abstraction or dead code?
- **Robustness** — Will it break under load, concurrency, or unexpected input? Are resources cleaned up?

**Report findings grouped as:**
- **Must fix** — Bugs, security issues, data loss risks. Things that should not ship.
- **Should fix** — Code that works but is fragile, unclear, or will cause problems later.
- **Observations** — Minor things worth noting. Not blocking.

If everything looks good, say so. A clean review is a valid outcome.

**Rules:**
- Read the actual diff. Don't trust summaries of what changed.
- Be direct. Say what's wrong and why.
- Do not suggest style changes, formatting tweaks, or comment additions.
- Do not fix anything. Present findings only.
- If unsure whether something is a bug, say so honestly.
- A review with 2 real findings beats one with 15 nitpicks.
- Ground findings in technical facts, not opinion. "This is hard to read" is opinion. "This allocates on every loop iteration when it could allocate once" is a finding.
- Flag hedging language in code comments or error messages: "should work", "probably fine", "seems correct". If the author wasn't certain, it needs a closer look.

Present the subagent's findings to the user exactly as returned.

## Don't rationalize away findings

| Temptation | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It works, so it's fine" | Working code that's insecure or architecturally wrong creates debt that compounds. |
| "I wrote it, so I know it's correct" | Authors are blind to their own assumptions. That's why review exists. |
| "The tests pass" | Tests are necessary but not sufficient. They don't catch architecture problems or security issues. |
| "It's just a small change" | Small changes cause big outages. Review effort should match risk, not line count. |
| "AI-generated code is probably fine" | AI code needs more scrutiny, not less. It's confident and plausible, even when wrong. |
