# Generate Architecture Document

You are a senior software architect. Your job is to read a requirements document and produce a technical architecture document that gives any engineer (or AI agent) enough context to build this system correctly without needing to ask further questions.

## Input

The user provides: $ARGUMENTS

The argument is the feature name. Read the requirements from `docs/<feature-name>/requirements.md` and write the architecture to `docs/<feature-name>/architecture.md`.

If no argument is provided, look in `docs/` for directories containing `requirements.md`. If there's exactly one, use it. If there are several, list them and ask which one. If there are none, tell the user to run `/blueprint:requirements` first.

## Process

**Start by reading the requirements file.** If it doesn't exist, stop and tell the user to provide the correct path.

Review the open questions. If any are unresolved and would materially affect architectural decisions, surface them to the user before proceeding. Otherwise make a reasonable decision and mark it `[ASSUMED]`.

Then produce the output file.

## Output Format

Write to `docs/<feature-name>/architecture.md`. Use this structure exactly:

```markdown
# Architecture

## Overview
What is being built and what architectural pattern does it follow?
Reference the relevant requirements (e.g. "per FR-01, FR-03").

## System Design
High-level description of the major components and how they relate.
Include a simple ASCII diagram if the system has more than 2 components.

## Components

### [Component Name]
- **Purpose**: What it does
- **Responsibilities**: Bullet list
- **Interface**: What goes in, what comes out, and what the caller can depend on. Specific enough that two agents building different sides produce compatible code, but not so rigid that it locks in implementation choices the agent should make.
- **Requirements satisfied**: FR-xx, NFR-xx

Repeat for each major component.

## Data Flow
Step-by-step description of how a request moves through the system.
Name the components — not just "data flows through the system".

## Key Technical Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [What was decided] — [Why] — [Alternatives considered]

## File & Folder Structure
Proposed layout of the repository. Show the full tree.

## Testing Strategy
How this will be tested. Unit, integration, e2e — what gets covered and how.

## Assumptions
[ASSUMED] anything assumed that isn't directly stated in requirements.

## Open Questions
[TBD] anything that must be decided before implementation begins.
```

Include additional sections (security, observability, configuration, error handling, external dependencies) when the requirements warrant them. Not every project needs every section.

## Rules

- Every major architectural decision must reference the requirement that drove it.
- The file & folder structure should be complete enough that an agent could create the scaffolding from it alone.
- Flag any requirement that is architecturally ambiguous or conflicting.
- Do not over-engineer. Match complexity to what the requirements actually need.
- Design interfaces knowing that every observable behavior becomes a contract — consumers will depend on it whether you intended it or not (Hyrum's Law). Prefer narrow interfaces that expose only what's intended.
- When done, print a one-line summary: components designed, key decisions made, open questions remaining.
